## Description

JS command line project that allows you to create a simple team roster html page by answering a series of questions. Quick way to put together a list of people on a simple format without writing any code, just need to open the terminal and run 'node index.js' and answer the series of questions.

## Installation

Clone the repo or download all of the files, run 'npm install' to ensure the prompts will work. 

## Usage

Whenever you want to create a file, run 'node index.js' in the terminal to trigger the series of questions that will determine the content. If you want to create multiple files, be sure to either re-name them or move them to separate folders or they will be overwritten each time a file is generated.
